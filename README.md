## Instructions

Roles:
- Event organizer: The person creating the sides game, adding questions, and sharing the game link to players.
- Player: A person entering the game with player ID and name via a game link.

1. An event organizer should create a new sides game in the main landing page https://sides.mtso.io. After the game is created, the event organizer will be redirected to the manager view. Make sure to bookmark this URL as it is the only way to access the manager view.
2. Share the game link with players (looks like "https://sides.mtso.io/name-of-game" where name-of-game is the generated game name).
3. Livestream the presentation view "https://sides.mtso.io/name-of-game/present".
4. Add questions in the manager view and open them to show the question to players. Players can pick a side for a question as long as the question is open.
